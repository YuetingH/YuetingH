# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yueting Han. I am currently a MSc student from [MathSys CDT](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/) at University of Warwick. My main research interest is network modelling. During this process, I pay particular attention to its visualization.

## Network Modelling Projects

### A. Bow-tie Structure of Online Social Networks on Vaccination Views Competition
> MathSys 2021-22 MSc Individual Project at University of Warwick.

A network represents entities in a complex system as nodes, and their pairwise relationships as edges. Network modelling enables data analysis at a large scale, which can provide a systematic understanding of behavioral ecology in areas such as computer science, social science, biology and physics. 

In this dissertation, we investigate a network structure known as â€˜bow-tie structureâ€™ in online social networks that represent interactive web pages on Facebook. Our analysis and preliminary prediction model show that this structure can shed light on the structural differences of information diffusion in different vaccine groups, and their evolution over time.

See details in GitHub Repo: [MSc_Indivudal_Project](https://github.com/YuetingH/MSc_Individual_Project). My dataset is also open available there for public research.

### B. Graph-Based Anomaly Detection in Healthcare Data
>MathSys 2021-22 MSc group project at University of Warwick.

Our external partners at [Kirontech](https://www.kirontech.com/) offer a Health Insurance Platform that helps insurance payers deal with anomalies in their insurance claims. Healthcare data naturally involves a number of relevant interactions between different entities. Kirontech has yet to explore graph-based anomaly detection (GBAD) techniques.

**The goal of this project is to adopt different GBAD methods on Kirontech's real-life dataset and provide evidence that graph-based data is useful to examine different anomalies.**

See details in GitHub Organization: [Kirontech-Project](https://github.com/Kirontech-Project).

### Network Visualization Resources
### A. Python Packages
- **nxviz**: https://github.com/ericmjl/nxviz
- **ForceAtlas2**: https://github.com/bhargavchippada/forceatlas2
- **curved_edges**: https://github.com/beyondbeneath/bezier-curved-edges-networkx


### B. Softwares
There are many visualization tools available for network analysis, which are detailedly evaluated [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5540468/).  Two softwares among them are used in this project. We particularly list the installation method for Ubuntu since it is our case.

#### 1. Gephi
- **Website**: https://gephi.org/
- **Technology**: C++, Qt
- **Platform**: Windows, Mac, Linux
- **Installation for Ubuntu**: https://lucahammer.com/2020/02/26/how-to-install-gephi-0-9-2-on-ubuntu-18-04

Gephi is an open-source graph analysis and visualization program. We use it to manually adjust graph layout by applying **ForceAtlas2**. 

#### 2. Tulip
- **Website**: https://tulip.labri.fr/site/
- **Technology**: Java
- **Platform**: Windows, Mac, Linux
- **Installation for Ubuntu**: [Tulip_quickstart.pdf](Network_Visualization/Tulip_quickstart.pdf)

Tulip is another open-source graph visualization and analysis tool. Here it is applied for **edge bundling**.

Explanation and other platforms for **edge bundling** are available [here](https://courses.isds.tugraz.at/ivis/surveys/ss2017/ivis-ss2017-g4-survey-edge-bundling.pdf).
