# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yueting Han. I am currently a MSc student from [MathSys CDT](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/) at University of Warwick. My main research interest is network modelling, keen on its visualization!

## Network Modelling

### Graph-Based Anomaly Detection in Healthcare Data
>MathSys 2021-22 MSc group project at University of Warwick.

Our external partners at [Kirontech](https://www.kirontech.com/) offer a Health Insurance Platform that helps insurance payers deal with anomalies in their insurance claims. Healthcare data naturally involves a number of relevant interactions between different entities. Kirontech has yet to explore graph-based anomaly detection (GBAD) techniques.

**The goal of this project is to adopt different GBAD methods on Kirontech's real-life dataset and provide evidence that graph-based data is useful to examine different anomalies.**

See details in GitHub Organization: [Kirontech-Project](https://github.com/Kirontech-Project).
